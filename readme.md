# EXIF Image Manipulator 
Change metadata from images, to whatever you want


## Technology
- We are using exiftool to play with meta data, this tool helps you to tinker with a wide variety of meta data types used in images

- Check out [exiftool](https://exiftool.org), credits to Phil Harvey

## Before we begin
- Anywhere you download images from contains some metadata that is used by different applications for various purposes
- This data sometimes also contains sensitive information such as your name, location and more
- To avoid information leakage beware of your devices setting and configs that attaches the information to every image you click.
- However after this trick became common and know to many people, most application which takes photos deletes all metadata attached to it.
- So now the chance of your information getting leaked is less, cause most people have implemented stuff to wipe down this information.
- But the goal of this tool is not to defend yourself only.
- You can change the meta data and use this tool for other creative purposes, (that's on you what you think is 'creative')
